"""
exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)

Draw samples from an exponential distribution.

Its probability density function is

.. math:: f(x; \\frac{1}{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\exp(-\\frac{x}{\\beta}),

for ``x > 0`` and 0 elsewhere. :math:`\\beta` is the scale parameter,
which is the inverse of the rate parameter :math:`\\lambda = 1/\\beta`.
The rate parameter is an alternative, widely used parameterization
of the exponential distribution [3]_.

The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the
geometric distribution.  It describes many common situations, such as
the size of raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1]_, or the time
between page requests to Wikipedia [2]_.

Parameters
----------
scale : float or array_like of floats
    The scale parameter, :math:`\\beta = 1/\\lambda`. Must be
    non-negative.
size : int or tuple of ints, optional
    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
    a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
    ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Drawn samples from the parameterized exponential distribution.
