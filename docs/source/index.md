# Welcome to mitchu

mitchu is a open source python library which I use to define and run agent based models.

The decision-making of actors is defined by a propensity to act in various ways given their current state and environment, and then a definition of the act itself -- how does it change their state, their connection to others, and others states?

## Install mitchu

1. Make sure that you have [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or greater installed.
2. Clone the GIT repository
3. Install the requirements in a virtualenv
4. Try it out!


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

- Your favorite IDE or text editor
- [Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)


If you haven't already, take a few minutes to read through [Main
concepts](main_concepts.md)


## Set up your virtual environment

Regardless of which package management tool you're using, we recommend running
these commands in a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies
pulled in for Streamlit don't impact any other Python projects
you're working on.

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
