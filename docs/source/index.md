# Welcome to mitchu

mitchu is a open source python library which I use to define and run agent based models.

The decision-making of actors is defined by a propensity to act in various ways given their current state and environment, and then a definition of the act itself -- how does it change their state, their connection to others, and others states?

## Install mitchu

1. Make sure that you have [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or greater installed.
2. Clone the GIT repository
3. Install the requirements in a virtualenv
4. Try it out!
